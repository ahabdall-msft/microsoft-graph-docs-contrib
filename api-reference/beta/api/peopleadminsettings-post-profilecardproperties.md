# Create profileCardProperty

Create a new [profileCardProperty](../resources/profilecardproperty.md) for an organization. The new property is identified by its **directoryPropertyName** property.

For more information about how to add properties to the profile card for an organization, see [Add or delete custom attributes on a profile card using the profile card API](/graph/add-properties-profilecard).
